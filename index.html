    <P>My current responsibilities are to provide a high quality development service, whilst also learning a thing or two.

        <h2>Big Dream</h2>
        <h3>Becomes worlds number 1 developer</h3>
        <p>With so much change taking place all at once, the dream to start a home-based business and be my own boss began to rise from the grave. It started with months of going through Craig’s List seeing all the part-time job openings for these back-office services. All of which I could do well, but did not want to get stuck working for a place that could not provide that thriving environment I needed.</p>
